rsync (3.1.3-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  Some useful rsync scripts that used to be installed in
  /usr/share/doc/rsync/scripts are now installed in
  /usr/share/rsync/scripts. All of them have execution permission.

  The rrsync script is now deployed into /usr/bin/rrsync as a
  symlink to /usr/share/rsync/scripts/rrsync.
